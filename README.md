# Mall-Customers-Segmentation-using-K-Means-Clustering

Clustering Analysis Performed on the Customers of a Mall based on some common parameters such as Annual Income(k$), Spending Score(1-100), Age and Gender, using Machine Learning Algorithms.

# Context
This data set is created only for the learning purpose of the customer segmentation concepts, also known as market basket analysis. I will demonstrate this by using unsupervised ML technique (KMeans Clustering Algorithm) in the simplest form.

# Content
You are owing a supermarket mall and through membership cards, you have some data about your customers like Customer ID, age, gender, annual income and spending score. Spending Score is something you assign to the customer based on your defined parameters like customer behavior and purchasing data.

# Problem Statement 
You own the mall and want to understand the customers like who can be easily converge [Target Customers] so that the sense can be given to marketing team and plan the strategy accordingly.
